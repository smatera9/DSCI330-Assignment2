<p> course desc: This course will give students an overview of 
the issues related to the management of unstructured data, i.e. 
data not stored in a table or database. Sources of unstructured 
data include bodies of text, social media applications, images, 
and audio. In the process of exploring various forms of 
unstructured data, students will be exposed to new programming 
languages and tools that are useful for managing this type of 
data (e.g. Python and bash). Other topics covered in the course 
include web scraping, natural language processing, and 
manipulating images/videos/audio files. Prerequisites: DSCI 210 
and CS 234, or instructorÂ¿s permission. Offered alternate years.
