<p> program desc: The BS Statistics Program provides students with 
instruction in the basic techniques, applications, and theories of 
mathematics and statistics. Students choosing statistics may 
complete a statistics project under the supervision of a faculty 
member. This provides students the opportunity to work with a 
faculty member on a consulting project or research problem. For 
students planning to attend graduate school, the research project is 
recommended. Internship opportunities also exist for students in the 
statistics major. Recent graduates have completed internships at the 
Mayo Clinic, insurance companies, local industry, and non-profit 
organizations. Both consulting projects and internships are good 
choices for students seeking employment upon graduation.
