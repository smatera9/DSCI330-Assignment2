<HTML> <h1> MAIN PAGE </h1> <p>Here are all of my 
programs!!!!!</p>

<ul> <li> <a href= "DSCI/DSCI.html " >DSCI </a> - The 
discipline of data science focuses on 
transforming data into knowledge. This degree requires a 
student to acquire knowledge and expertise in data science 
through an understanding of analytical and computational 
techniques, an interdisciplinary emphasis, and a capstone 
experience. </li>
<li> <a href= "Spanish/Spanish.html " > SPANISH</a> - Aside from the 
obvious enhancement of one’s 
marketability in the workforce as a speaker of more than one 
language, knowledge of foreign languages leads to a more 
widely open and empathetic mind. Once we get past the initial 
embarrassment of speaking another language–the fear of making 
mistakes intimidates almost everyone–most of us find a most 
peculiar phenomenon occurs: we begin to develop a kind of 
“alter-ego” for ourselves, someone who is still us, but a 
slightly different version of us. We develop (and are 
conscious of) the ability to think from both versions of 
ourselves, and most important, to see problems and questions 
from a variety of points of view. It would be difficult to 
deny that much of the conflict in our world occurs because 
people simply cannot see beyond their own cultural 
perspective; the study and use of foreign languages is the 
fastest, most effective path to cultural and global 
understanding. </li>

<li> <a href= "STAT/STAT.html">STATS</a> - The BS Statistics 
Program provides students 
with instruction in the basic techniques, applications, 
and theories of mathematics and statistics. Students 
choosing statistics may complete a statistics project 
under the supervision of a faculty member. This provides 
students the opportunity to work with a faculty member on 
a consulting project or research problem. For students 
planning to attend graduate school, the research project 
is recommended. Internship opportunities also exist for 
students in the statistics major. Recent graduates have 
completed internships at the Mayo Clinic, insurance 
companies, local industry, and non-profit organizations. 
Both consulting projects and internships are good choices 
for students seeking employment upon graduation.

</li>
<li> <a href= "English/English.html"> ENGLISH </a>- The English 
Department is concerned with 
the English language as art and communication. At the 
lower academic levels, courses are designed to help 
students acquire competence in reading and writing, 
thinking critically, and understanding and responding to 
aesthetic values.</li>
